# 📊 Student Performance Data Pipeline (Pandas Version)

This project rebuilds a manual data-cleaning workflow using **pandas** to simulate how real-world machine learning pipelines process raw data.

## 🚀 Objective

Transform messy student performance records into a structured, ML-ready dataset.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- Reading raw data using `pandas`
- Handling missing and invalid values
- Converting data types safely
- Feature engineering:
  - Average score
  - Maximum score
  - Minimum score
  - Standard deviation
- Rule-based performance classification
- Exporting processed dataset for ML use

---

## 🏗 Why This Matters

In real AI systems, models fail more from poor data quality than from weak algorithms.

This project focuses on:
- Data preprocessing
- Structured transformation
- Logical decision systems
- Scalability compared to manual Python loops

## 📤 Output

The final output is a clean CSV file ready for:
- Machine learning training
- Data analysis
- Visualization
- Further modeling
