# Day 1 — Foundations

## What I learned
- What CSV files are and how real-world data is stored
- How Python functions work (input → logic → output)
- How to read external files using Python

## Files
- students.csv: sample dataset
- day1_functions.py: Python functions practice

## Key takeaway
Strong foundations matter more than rushing into tools.
