# Day 2 — Python Data Structures & Logic

## Focus
Understanding how real-world data is represented and processed in pure Python.

## What I did
- Worked with lists and dictionaries to model structured data
- Used loops and functions to process multiple records
- Built a small data pipeline to compute averages and classify performance

## Why this matters
Libraries like Pandas automate these steps.
Understanding the underlying logic makes debugging, optimization,
and interviews significantly easier.
